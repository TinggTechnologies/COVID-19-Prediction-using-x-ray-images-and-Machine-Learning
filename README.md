# NN-and-SVM
Implementing a program using Neural Network and Support Vector Machine to predict weather a patientâ€™s x-ray is suspected to COVID19 or not.
Requirements
1. Binarize the input dataset with a suitable threshold value.
2. Resize images into suitable size 
3. Separate data into training and testing datasets
4. Implement 2 different classification models
  4.1. Neural Network
  4.2. Support Vector Machine
